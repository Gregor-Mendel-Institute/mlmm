Description: The mlmm R package contains functions to carry out GWAS with MLMM
    and plot the results from the analysis. Two versions are currently available:
    mlmm, the original MLMM as described in Segura, VilhjÃ¡lmsson et al (Nat Gen
    2012), and mlmm_cof, a modified version of MLMM that allows including a fixed
    covariate in the association model, for example a matrix of principal components
    scores (MLMM version of the "PK" model) or any feature that would make sense to
    regress out (e.g. sex).
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.2),
    emma (>= 1.1.2)
